# Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Laws

## Ohm's Law #ohms-law

Ohm's Law defines the relationship between **voltage (V)**, **current (I)**, and **resistance (R)**:

> V = I × R

Where:
- V is voltage in volts (V)
- I is current in amperes (A)
- R is resistance in ohms (Ω)

## Kirchhoff's Laws

### 1. Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) #kirchhoff-1

The total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving it.

> ∑I_in = ∑I_out

### 2. Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) #kirchhoff-2

The sum of all voltages around a closed loop is zero.

> ∑V = 0

These laws are fundamental in analyzing electrical circuits.
